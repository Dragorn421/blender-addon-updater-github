Where possible, everything in this repository is placed in the public domain

However, note that, from https://www.blender.org/about/license/ :
    Blenderâ€™s Python API is an integral part of the software, used to define the user interface or develop tools for example. The GNU GPL license therefore requires that such scripts (if published) are being shared under a GPL compatible license. You are free to sell such scripts, but the sales then is restricted to the download service itself. Your customers will receive the script under the same license (GPL), with the same free conditions as everyone has for Blender.

This means some of the code is instead licensed under the GNU GPL v3. (see gpl3.txt)
